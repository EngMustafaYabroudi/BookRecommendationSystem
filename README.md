## Book Recommendation System NoteBook

**Project Summary:**

This project is a book recommendation system that utilizes data preprocessing and trains a KNN model. The system processes book data from a large dataset and trains a KNN model on this data. Users can then input a book title, and the system will return 5 similar books.

**Project Components:**

* **Book Data:** A large dataset of books is used, including information such as title, author, description, and genres.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Book data is preprocessed before training the KNN model. This includes cleaning the data, removing missing values, and transforming the data into a format that the KNN model can understand.
* **KNN Model:** A KNN model is trained on the preprocessed book data. The KNN model can then be used to recommend books similar to a given book.

**How to Use the Project:**

1. Clone the project's Git Hub repository.
3. Install the requirements.
4. Download the book dataset.
5. Preprocess the book data.
6. Train the KNN model.
7. Input a book title to get 5 similar books.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.6 or later
* NumPy
* Pandas
* scikit-learn

**License:**

This project is licensed under the MIT License.

**Notes:**

* This project is for educational purposes only.
* Recommendation results may not be entirely accurate.
* The project can be improved in several ways, such as using natural language processing techniques to improve the system's understanding of book descriptions.

## Book Recommendation System using Spring Boot

**Project Summary:**

This project is a book recommendation system developed using Spring Boot, leveraging Spring Security and Spring Data to create a secure and scalable web application. The system utilizes MySQL as the underlying database for storing and managing user, book, and rating data.

**Key Features:**

1. **User Management System:** The system supports user registration, login, and management with different roles (e.g., reader, admin).

2. **Book Management System:** The system allows adding, editing, and deleting books from the MySQL database.

3. **Book Rating System:** Users can rate books on a scale of 1 to 5. Ratings are stored in the MySQL database.

4. **Book Recommendation System:** The system provides book recommendations based on user preferences and book ratings from other users. Recommendations are generated using algorithms and stored in the MySQL database.

5. **JWT Authentication and Authorization:** The system employs JWT authentication and authorization to secure access to data and functionalities. JWT tokens are stored in the MySQL database.

6. **Swagger Documentation:** The API is documented using Swagger, making it easier for developers to understand and utilize the available functionalities.

**Tech Stack:**

* **Spring Boot:** Java framework for building standalone web applications.
* **Spring Security:** Spring component for securing applications.
* **Spring Data JPA:** Spring component for facilitating data access to MySQL database.
* **MySQL:** Relational database management system for storing and managing data.
* **JWT:** JSON Web Token-based authentication and authorization technique.
* **Swagger:** API documentation tool.

**How to Use:**

1. **Clone the project's Git Hub repository.**
2. **Install the required dependencies, including MySQL Connector.**
3. **Configure MySQL database connection settings in the application properties.**
4. **Run the Spring Boot application.**
5. **Utilize Swagger to explore and use the API.**
