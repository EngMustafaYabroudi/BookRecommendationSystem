## Book Recommendation System NoteBook

**Project Summary:**

This project is a book recommendation system that utilizes data preprocessing and trains a KNN model. The system processes book data from a large dataset and trains a KNN model on this data. Users can then input a book title, and the system will return 5 similar books.

**Project Components:**

* **Book Data:** A large dataset of books is used, including information such as title, author, description, and genres.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Book data is preprocessed before training the KNN model. This includes cleaning the data, removing missing values, and transforming the data into a format that the KNN model can understand.
* **KNN Model:** A KNN model is trained on the preprocessed book data. The KNN model can then be used to recommend books similar to a given book.

**How to Use the Project:**

1. Clone the project's Git Hub repository.
3. Install the requirements.
4. Download the book dataset.
5. Preprocess the book data.
6. Train the KNN model.
7. Input a book title to get 5 similar books.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.6 or later
* NumPy
* Pandas
* scikit-learn

**Notes:**

* This project is for educational purposes only.
* Recommendation results may not be entirely accurate.
* The project can be improved in several ways, such as using natural language processing techniques to improve the system's understanding of book descriptions.
